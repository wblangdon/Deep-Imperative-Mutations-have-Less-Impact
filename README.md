FlameGraph of Linux perf profile of gem5 simulating our RNAfold fragment.
Used functions are spread horizontally,
whilst vertical axis indicates depth of function call nesting.

Fig 2. was created using Brendan Gregg's flamegraph.pl, using data collected by Linux perf when profiling gem5.
[perf_g_gem5_higher_order_code_209.svg](perf_g_gem5_higher_order_code_209.svg) is an iteractive scalar vector graphics format.
